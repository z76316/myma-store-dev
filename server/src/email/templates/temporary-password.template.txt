Hi {{name}},

Go to {{storeDomain}}{{resetPasswordRoute}}?email={{email}}&temporaryPassword={{temporaryPassword}}
to reset your account's password.

If the link doesn't work, navigate to {{storeDomain}}{{resetPasswordRoute}} and
paste in your temporary password: {{temporaryPassword}}.

Your temporary password will be valid for the next 24 hours. If you,
have not reset your password within that time, you will need to request
another temporary password.

{{storeDomain}}{{contactRoute}}?email={{email}}.
